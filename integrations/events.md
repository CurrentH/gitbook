# Events

Sorry-cypress provides integration with popular 3rd party tools - it reports test runs progress together with results.&#x20;

The following events are supported:

* `RUN_START` - run has started
* `INSTANCE_START` - a spec file started execution
* `INSTANCE_FINISH` - a spec file reported completion
* `RUN_FINISH` - runs finished after reaching [Inactivity Timeout](broken-reference)

You can edit the integration individually for each project.

See the detailed documentation for each integration type.
